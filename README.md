Hi everyone! This is my first weather project. I know it's not a difficult one but it is just the beginning!
I have used html, css and js, as well as I have used Open Weather Map Api. If you want to use it for free just copy my api key, and weather version! Good Luck and have a nice day!
Warning! I have used weather api to update my weather!
